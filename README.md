Reggie 
======

Reggie is an experimental light weight alternative to a full blown npm registry. 

# Why?

NPM is amazing, but managing your own NPM registry should be easier. Wouldn't it be great if all you had to do
to set up your own private NPM registry was to install an NPM module and start it? In other words, you didn't have to
install and manage CouchDB, replicate from the public NPM repo, etc.? 

Reggie is currently an experiment. It currently supports:

* registering/uploading packages generated by `npm pack`
* installing packages through a tarbal NPM dependency convention 
* supports basic semver wildcards (1.1.x) and ranges
* a few basic routes to see what's registered
* flat file storage that's simple to back-up and restore

Here's what it doesn't do yet:

* authentication on publish
* searching for packages
* publish time metadata

Here's what it will never do

* authentication on package installs (GET /package/:name/:range)
* be API compatible with a proper NPM registry

Also, there aren't any tests yet. I know, I know, but this is an experiment... bear with me.


# Using Reggie

## Installation

Into a local directory:

    npm install reggie
    ./node_modules/.bin/reggie-server

Or globally (with data at ~/reggie):

    npm install -g reggie
    reggie-server -d ~/.reggie

## Publishing

If installed globally, from within the root directory of an NPM module:

	reggie publish http://<host:port>
	reggie publish http://127.0.0.1:8080

The Reggie client just `npm packs` your module and `PUT`s it to `http://<host:post>/package/:name/:version`.

## Installing from Reggie

Whether you do `npm install` from the shell or resolve the package within the `dependencies` of 
a `package.json`, you specify the dependency as a tarball URL.

### A sepecific version

	npm install http://<host:port>/package/<name>/<version>
	npm install http://<host:port>/package/foo/1.0.0

In a `package.json`:

	dependencies: {
		"foo": "http://<host:port>/package/foo/1.0.0"
	}


### Wildcard version

	http://<host:port>/package/foo/1.0.x
	http://<host:port>/package/foo/1.0
	http://<host:port>/package/foo/1
	http://<host:port>/package/foo/x


### Ranges

By convention, Reggie understands URLs with `gt` (>), `gte` (>=), `lt' (<), and `lte` (<=), for example:

	http://<host:port>/package/foo/lt/2.0              # less than 2.0
	http://<host:port>/package/foo/lte/1.9             # less than or equal 1.9
	http://<host:port>/package/foo/lt/2/gt/1           # less than 2 (2.0, 2.0.0) and greater than 1 (1.0,1.0.0)
	http://<host:port>/package/foo/lt/2.0.0/gte/1.0.0  # less than 2.0.0 and greater than 1.0.0
	http://<host:port>/package/foo/gte/1.5.0           # greater than 1.5.0
	http://<host:port>/package/foo/gt/1.5.0/lte/4.0    # less than 4.0


## Start-up options

You can see the available options with `reggie-server -h`

	-d, --data  Directory to store Reggie's data  [default: <cwd>/data]
	-p, --port  Reggie's a good listener. What port should I listen on?  [default: 8080]


When Reggie starts up, it will reparse all of the packages in it's data directory and reload it's metadata. So this means you can seed Reggie with a bunch of NPM module tarballs if you want by copying them to `<--data>/packages`. With many modules, Reggie will be slow to start-up. I expect this to be optimized in the future. Also in the future may be auto detection of new modules if they are simply copied into the packages directory.


## Other routes

Returns a JSON array of all known packages and versions:

	GET http://<host:port>/index

Returns JSON array of known versions for a particular module name:

	GET http://<host:port>/versions/:name


# What's Next?

I would love your feedback! Like I said in the beginning, this is somewhat of an experiment at this point but I'm optimistic that Reggie could materialize into a useful lightweight alternative to servicing up private packages to NPM. Create issues in this repo or hit me up on Twitter @mbrevoort.
